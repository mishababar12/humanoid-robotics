# Module 4 Outline: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This document provides a detailed outline for Module 4 of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook.

## Learning Objectives

*   Understand the concept of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.
*   Learn how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated into robotics.
*   Understand the challenges and opportunities of human-robot interaction.
*   Be able to build a simple VLA system that allows a robot to be controlled with natural language.

## Key Topics

1.  **Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**
