# Capstone Humanoid Project

This capstone project integrates all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to develop a comprehensive solution for a simulated humanoid robot.

## Project Goal
Develop a system for a simulated humanoid robot that can perceive its environment, understand natural language commands, and perform a sequence of tasks.

## Key Components to Integrate
*   **ROS 2 Control:** For robot actuation and sensor data processing.
*   **Gazebo/Unity Simulation:** For the simulated humanoid robot environment.
*   **NVIDIA Isaac Perception:** For visual perception tasks (e.g., object recognition, VSLAM).
*   **VLA & Conversational AI:** For interpreting natural language commands and cognitive planning.

## Deliverables
*   **Project Proposal:** Outline the specific tasks the humanoid robot will perform and the technologies used.
*   **Codebase:** Well-documented ROS 2 packages and associated scripts.
*   **Simulation Demonstration:** A video or live demonstration of the humanoid robot successfully completing its tasks in simulation.
*   **Technical Report:** Documenting the design, implementation, challenges, and results of the project.

## Suggested Project Ideas
*   **Object Manipulation:** Command the humanoid to pick up and place objects in specific locations.
*   **Navigation & Interaction:** Guide the humanoid through a cluttered environment, responding to verbal cues and avoiding obstacles.
*   **Collaborative Task:** Design a scenario where the humanoid assists a human in a simple task.
