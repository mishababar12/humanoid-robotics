# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook**, your AI-native guide to understanding, designing, and experimenting with physical AI systems and humanoid robots. This textbook has been created as part of a comprehensive course using Docusaurus, integrated with interactive exercises, code examples, diagrams, and a RAG-powered AI assistant.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an interactive, modular, and hands-on learning experience for students and enthusiasts:

- Learn the fundamentals of **Physical AI**.
- Understand the **humanoid robotics landscape**.
- Explore **ROS2 architecture, nodes, and topics**.
- Gain hands-on experience with **Gazebo and Unity simulations**.
- Work with **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** and real-world robot models.
- Integrate **AI systems, LLMs, and vision-language models** into robotics workflows.

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into **13 weeks of content** with additional modules, assessments, and resources:

- **Weeks 1–2:** Introduction to Physical AI, embodied intelligence, humanoid landscape, and sensor systems.
- **Weeks 3–5:** ROS2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, Python integration, and launch parameters.
- **Weeks 6–7:** Gazebo setup, URDF/SDF models, physics simulations, Unity visualizations.
- **Weeks 8–10:** NVIDIA Isaac introduction, perception & manipulation, reinforcement learning, sim-to-real pipelines.
- **Weeks 11–12:** Humanoid kinematics, bipedal locomotion, manipulation & grasping, human-robot interaction.
- **Week 13:** Conversational robotics, GPT integration, speech recognition, and multimodal interaction.

Additional **modules** cover ROS2, digital twin frameworks, Isaac Sim, and vision-language applications.

## Interactive Features

This textbook includes:

- **Hands-on coding exercises** in Python and ROS2.
- **Mermaid diagrams** for system flows and robotics pipelines.
- **3D robot visualizations** and URDF previews.
- **RAG-powered AI assistant** for answering questions based on textbook content.
- **Personalization options** to adapt content based on your experience.
- **Urdu translation toggle** to make content accessible in multiple languages.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the docs folder and explore chapters week by week.
2. Follow code examples and exercises in each module.
3. Use the AI assistant to ask questions or clarify concepts.
4. Practice with guided exercises and complete assessments.
