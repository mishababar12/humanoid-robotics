# Unity Visualization Setups

This directory will contain Unity projects and assets for visualizing the robot simulations.

## Setting up a Unity Project

To set up a Unity project for robotics visualization, you will need to:

1.  Install Unity Hub and a recent version of the Unity Editor.
2.  Create a new 3D Unity project.
3.  Install the Unity Robotics Hub packages from the Unity Asset Store or via the Package Manager.
4.  Configure the ROS TCP Connector to connect to your ROS 2 network.
5.  Import your robot's URDF model into the Unity project.
6.  Add a TF (Transform) subscriber to visualize the robot's movements.

Detailed instructions and a pre-configured Unity project will be provided in a later update.
